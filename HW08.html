        <P>Pltypuses are kinda neat, They are the only egg laying mammal, They have a elctrosensory bill, but also have a set of teeth.</P>
        <p>Their esophpgus connects directly to their intenstines, as they do not have a stomach.</p>
        <p>ALSO they SWEAT THEIR MILK AND HAVE VENOMOUS CLAWS.</p>
